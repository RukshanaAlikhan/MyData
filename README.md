Project Vision: “MyData – See What You Leak”

A lightweight browser extension that helps students understand how much of their personal data is exposed online — through cookies, trackers, autofill data, and permissions and gives them a “Data Health Score.”

#Core Objectives

Awareness: Let users see what’s happening behind the scenes when they browse.

Empowerment: Give actionable privacy improvement tips.

Gamification: Add a “Data Health Score” to make it engaging (like a cyber hygiene score).

Education tie-in: Use it in awareness booths or class demos — “scan your browser live!”
